# NBA-Player-Classification
Using the four factor model, NBA team performances were analyzed. The data was collected by copying and pasting advanced team stats from
basketball-reference.com for the 2021 and 2022 season. These data sets were then filtered for the
offensive and defensive four-factors, and each team was ranked in each category. In addition, using historical data, a new classification framework was created for identifying player type. A
script was written to scrape data from basketball-reference.com from the past 5 seasons (not including
current season). The player data that was obtained was player per 100 poss stats, advanced stats, and
shooting stats, and they were all merged into one dataset.
